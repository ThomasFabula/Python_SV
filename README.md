## PyMove3d contest
In 2012 at the »PyCon DE« in Leipzig an proposal to establish a programming contest was discussed. It should teach young people Python, our preferred programming language and one we use in our jobs. Soon, the conference was over but nothing happened!
In march 2013, Peter Koppatz asked Reimar Bauer at the »Linuxtag« in Berlin about the progress with the idea of a programming contest. Reimar answered that nothing had happened since Leipzig!
So Peter presented the idea to combine programming with python and building 3D worlds. Still skeptical, Reimar listened to Peter and he recognized the huge potential of this idea. And so the stone began to roll. Now the first competition is over. And its success is motivation to improve the course material and prepare a version that can easily translated to other languages.
